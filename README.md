# Playing-With-Python---Data-Engineering

This repository contains python codes for concepts that I learnt while studying "Learning Python - O'Reilly".
It also contains Python programs demonstrating the use of various libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc. 
Reference used here was - "Wes McKinney-Python for Data Analysis. Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython-Oâ€™Reilly"
